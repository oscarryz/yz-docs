## Bugs

- [ ] **[YZC-0008] Same-cown reentrant scheduling deadlock**

  Any code path that calls `Schedule(&self.Cown, ...)` while already executing inside a closure
  scheduled on `self.Cown` deadlocks — the outer task waits for its own completion.

  **Known manifestations:**

  1. **Local boc vars in main** (`37_local_boc_var` — confirmed deadlock with `TestRuntime`):
     Local boc variables (`foo #(String) = { ... }`) are lowered as methods on the enclosing
     singleton (`_mainBoc.Foo()`). When `Call()` — which holds `self.Cown` — calls
     `self.Foo().Force()`, `Foo()` schedules on the same `self.Cown` → deadlock.

  2. **HOF closures inside ScheduleMulti** (original case, still dormant):
     A closure passed as a callback argument and generated inside a `ScheduleMulti` body
     contains sync-body calls that assume the cown is held. If the closure escapes and is
     invoked outside the multi-cown body, those calls fire without holding the cown — data race.

  3. **Recursive local bocs** (was failing, now passing — see note):
     A local boc `f` calling itself via `self.F(n-1).Force()` inside `f()` would re-acquire
     `self.Cown` while held. This was the `39_local_boc_recursive` case; it currently passes,
     likely because the recursive call is handled inline rather than scheduled.

  **Root cause:** the lowerer emits all local boc vars as methods on the enclosing struct,
  sharing its cown. There is no mechanism to detect or prevent a task re-scheduling on a cown
  it already holds.

  **Fix direction:** Phase E.1 (implicit BocGroup per scope) removes statement-position `.Force()`
  calls, eliminating the blocking wait that causes the deadlock. Alternatively, local boc vars
  could be lowered to plain Go closures (not cown-scheduled methods) when they don't capture
  cown-bearing state — this would be a targeted fix without requiring the full Phase E rewrite.

## Major Features

### YZC-0024 — `return`, `break`, `continue`

Blocked on concurrency model (YZC-0019, YZC-0023).

- [ ] Parser — `BreakStmt` / `ContinueStmt` AST nodes
- [ ] Sema — validate context
- [ ] Lowerer — emit compile error when encountered
- [ ] Spec 07 — update
- [ ] Golden tests — sema-level error tests

### YZC-0088 — Codegen: attach compiled annotation boc to declaration metadata

Deferred from YZC-0025. Once the macro system (YZC-0028) is defined, the compiler needs to store the parsed+type-checked annotation `*BocLiteral` alongside its target declaration so that macro passes can inspect and transform it.

- [ ] Define representation: how the annotation boc is stored on `ir.StructDecl` / `ir.SingletonDecl` / `ir.FuncDecl`
- [ ] Codegen — emit annotation metadata in generated Go (or as a side channel for the macro runner)
- [ ] Wire into macro invocation pipeline (YZC-0028)

### YZC-0028 — Macros (`Macro` interface)

Any boc with `Schema #()` and `run #(Boc, Boc)` satisfies `Macro`. Depends on: YZC-0025, YZC-0026, YZC-0027, YZC-0030, YZC-0066, YZC-0059.

- [ ] Sema — recognize `Macro` structural interface
- [ ] Sema — scan annotation for `macros: [...]`
- [ ] Boc metatype — `Boc` value type for `run`
- [ ] Two-phase build — compile `Compile` implementations first
- [ ] Serialization — `Boc` wire format
- [ ] AST merge — merge returned `Boc` into parent
- [ ] Cycle detection
- [ ] Caching — keyed on source hash
- [ ] Spec 12 — new spec file

### YZC-0031 — Scalar Types in Yz Source (uppering)

`Int/String/Bool/Decimal/Unit` move from Go to `stdlib/` with `compile-time:[Native]`. Depends on: YZC-0025, YZC-0028, YZC-0002.

- [ ] Define `macros: [Native]` annotation semantics
- [ ] Move scalar types to `stdlib/`
- [ ] Annotate native ops per method
- [ ] Implement higher-level methods in Yz
- [ ] Remove all primitive-type special-casing from the compiler
- [ ] `Bool.&&`/`||` — rewrite as lazy closure-taking boc methods

### YZC-0076 — Existential associated types: opaque-token / path-identity tracking

**Status note:** YZC-0075 was superseded by YZC-0079, which established that Yz uses structural typing rather than nominal path-identity for associated types. It is unclear whether this ticket is still needed — the opaque-token / cross-root rejection problem it describes may be moot in a fully structural system. Revisit after YZC-0079 has been used in real code; close if no concrete use case emerges.

Phase 2: the hard part. Deferred until YZC-0079 is settled and there is real usage demand.

- [ ] *design* — decide path-variable representation in the type system
- [ ] *design* — define scoping rules for opaque tokens (block-scoped vs field-storable)
- [ ] Sema — tag values with their existential path root at the point of production
- [ ] Sema — verify path roots match at call sites consuming opaque tokens
- [ ] Sema — reject cross-root usage with a clear error
- [ ] Conformance tests — opaque-token round-trip; cross-root rejection

### YZC-0080 — Uniform boc literal typing: one structural type derived from elements

#### Invariant

> Every boc literal, regardless of where it appears, receives one structural type derived mechanically from its elements. No code path branches on "is this a closure or a struct?" — that distinction is resolved at the use site by structural compatibility, not by classification during analysis.

#### Target design

Every boc literal gets one rich structural type:

```
BocLiteralType {
    Params    []BocParam      // TypedDecl nil-value entries → input signature
    Methods   []MethodField   // ShortDecl+BocLiteral or BocDecl-with-body entries
    Fields    []ValueField    // TypedDecl with value or ShortDecl with non-boc value
    Returns   []Type          // last-expression type(s)
}
```

#### Dependencies

Likely needs YZC-0025 (annotations / compile-time metadata). May also simplify YZC-0031.

- [ ] Design: define `BocLiteralType` in `sema/types.go`
- [ ] Sema: assign `BocLiteralType` to every `*ast.BocLiteral` in `analyzeExpr`; delete classification branches
- [ ] Sema: structural compatibility between `BocLiteralType` and `BocType` / `StructType` / interfaces
- [ ] Lowerer: dispatch on use-site expected type instead of sema classification flags
- [ ] Delete `hasInnerBocsOrMethods`, `bocLitHasParams`, `anonBocCache`, `anonDecls` from lowerer
- [ ] All existing tests pass

### YZC-0082 — Struct-outer nested type (concrete associated type)

`Foo: { Bar: {} }` — `Bar` is a type definition scoped to `Foo`; instances of `Foo` expose it as `f.Bar()`.

- [ ] *design* — decide whether inner type bodies can reference outer instance fields (path-dependent vs. self-contained)
- [ ] Sema: recognize uppercase struct-literal inside struct boc as concrete associated type definition
- [ ] Sema: `f.Bar()` resolves to the inner type; enforce no `Foo.Bar()` static access
- [ ] Lowerer: emit inner type as package-level Go struct; `f.Bar()` → constructor call
- [ ] Golden test: `Foo: { Bar: {} }` + `f.Bar()` compiles and runs

### YZC-0084 — Generic instantiation alias: `StringList : List(String)`

`StringList : List(String)` should declare a type alias for a concrete generic instantiation. Depends on: YZC-0027.

- [ ] *design* — decide emission: `type StringList = List[std.String]` (Go alias) or `type StringList struct { ... }` (copy)
- [ ] Sema: recognize `Name : GenericType(Args)` as instantiation alias
- [ ] Lowerer: emit appropriate Go type declaration
- [ ] `StringList(...)` constructor call works
- [ ] Golden test
