## Bugs

- [ ] **[YZC-0008] Same-cown reentrant scheduling deadlock**

  Any code path that calls `Schedule(&self.Cown, ...)` while already executing inside a closure
  scheduled on `self.Cown` deadlocks — the outer task waits for its own completion.

  **Known manifestations:**

  1. **Local boc vars in main** (`37_local_boc_var` — confirmed deadlock with `TestRuntime`):
     Local boc variables (`foo #(String) = { ... }`) are lowered as methods on the enclosing
     singleton (`_mainBoc.Foo()`). When `Call()` — which holds `self.Cown` — calls
     `self.Foo().Force()`, `Foo()` schedules on the same `self.Cown` → deadlock.

  2. **HOF closures inside ScheduleMulti** (original case, still dormant):
     A closure passed as a callback argument and generated inside a `ScheduleMulti` body
     contains sync-body calls that assume the cown is held. If the closure escapes and is
     invoked outside the multi-cown body, those calls fire without holding the cown — data race.

  3. **Recursive local bocs** (was failing, now passing — see note):
     A local boc `f` calling itself via `self.F(n-1).Force()` inside `f()` would re-acquire
     `self.Cown` while held. This was the `39_local_boc_recursive` case; it currently passes,
     likely because the recursive call is handled inline rather than scheduled.

  **Root cause:** the lowerer emits all local boc vars as methods on the enclosing struct,
  sharing its cown. There is no mechanism to detect or prevent a task re-scheduling on a cown
  it already holds.

  **Fix direction:** Phase E.1 (implicit BocGroup per scope) removes statement-position `.Force()`
  calls, eliminating the blocking wait that causes the deadlock. Alternatively, local boc vars
  could be lowered to plain Go closures (not cown-scheduled methods) when they don't capture
  cown-bearing state — this would be a targeted fix without requiring the full Phase E rewrite.

## Thunk / Concurrency

- [ ] **[YZC-0094] Fully lazy thunk model: propagate thunks through all expressions, force only at BocGroup boundary** *(design)*

  ### History

  - **Phase E.2** (commit `64ea0ea`): tried putting laziness *inside* scalar
    types — `Int`, `String`, etc. got optional lazy fields; boc calls returned
    the scalar type directly. `GoWait` replaced `Go+Force`.
  - **Phase E.3** (commit `fc0989a`): reverted. Scalars are plain again; all
    boc methods return `*Thunk[T]`. Added `GoStore[T]` for typed-decl boc
    calls. `thunkVars` / auto-forcing re-introduced.

  Neither phase reached the correct model because bigger tickets were in the
  way. The backlog is now clear enough to revisit.

  ### Target model

  Every boc call returns a `*Thunk[T]`. **Thunks are never forced eagerly.**
  Instead they propagate through all expressions and are forced only when the
  boc body's BocGroup resolves them at the end:

  ```yz
  g : greet()           // Thunk[String]  — goroutine launched
  w : world.say()       // Thunk[String]  — goroutine launched, both concurrent

  g == "hi from greet"    // Thunk[Bool]  — no goroutine, cold chain
  ? { print("ok") }, {}  // Thunk[Unit]  — still lazy

  w == "hello from world"
  ? { print("ok") }, {}  // Thunk[Unit]
  ```

  Main's BocGroup forces every statement-level `Thunk[Unit]` at the bottom.
  Forcing cascades inward (pull-based): `Thunk[Unit]` → forces `Thunk[Bool]`
  → forces `Thunk[String]` → goroutine completes.

  BocGroup is **necessary**: Go kills un-waited goroutines when `main()`
  returns, so structured concurrency must always wait at the end of each boc.

  ### Why `==`, `?`, etc. produce thunks

  In Yz, `==` and `?` are ordinary method calls, not operators with special
  compiler rules. Consistency requires they behave the same regardless of
  whether their arguments are concrete values or thunks. Therefore:

  - `Thunk[String].Eqeq(String)` → `Thunk[Bool]`
  - `Thunk[Bool].Qm(Thunk[Unit], Thunk[Unit])` → `Thunk[Unit]`

  This is implemented by making `Thunk[T]` forward all of `T`'s methods,
  returning `Thunk[ReturnType]` rather than `ReturnType`.

  Variables and inline calls are identical — `g == "hi"` and `greet() == "hi"`
  both produce `Thunk[Bool]` with no forcing difference.

  ### Waiting IS forcing — BocGroup simplification

  Today `GoWait` spawns a *meta-goroutine* that calls `.Force()` on a thunk
  and signals `sync.WaitGroup`. This is a two-layer design: boc goroutine +
  meta-goroutine just to do the force.

  In the fully lazy model this collapses. The boc goroutines launched by
  `Schedule` are already running concurrently. Forcing their thunks
  *sequentially* loses nothing — by the time we force thunk 2, goroutine 2 is
  already running (or done). Total wait time is still the slowest goroutine,
  same as a WaitGroup.

  Therefore `BocGroup` becomes:

  ```go
  type BocGroup struct{ thunks []Forceable }

  func (g *BocGroup) Add(th Forceable)  { g.thunks = append(g.thunks, th) }
  func (g *BocGroup) Wait() {
      for _, th := range g.thunks { th.Force() }
  }
  ```

  - No `sync.WaitGroup`
  - No `GoWait` (meta-goroutine eliminated)
  - No `GoStore` (`g : greet()` holds `*Thunk[String]`, not a concrete value)
  - `Wait()` IS the forcing mechanism — waiting and forcing are the same act

  ### Note on "truly lazy"

  `Thunk[T]` already supports both forms (see `thunk.go`):

  - `Go[T](fn)` — hot thunk: goroutine launched immediately, result cached
    when the goroutine completes.
  - `NewThunk[T](fn)` — cold thunk: no goroutine, `fn` runs in the caller's
    goroutine the first time `Force()` is called, result cached via `sync.Once`.

  Forwarding methods on `Thunk[T]` are therefore trivial cold thunks:

  ```go
  func (th *Thunk[String]) Eqeq(other String) *Thunk[Bool] {
      return NewThunk(func() Bool { return th.Force().Eqeq(other) })
  }
  ```

  The goroutines are genuinely concurrent — `Force()` on a hot thunk blocks
  until the goroutine completes. The current overhead is the meta-goroutines
  spawned by `GoStore` to force hot thunks — those are eliminated here.

  ### Implementation plan

  **Phase 1 — Runtime (`runtime/rt/`)**

  - [ ] `thunk.go`: no changes needed; `NewThunk` and `Go` are already correct.
  - [ ] `core.go`:
    - [ ] Replace `BocGroup.sync.WaitGroup` with `[]func()` (slice of force
      closures) or a `Forceable` interface slice.
    - [ ] `BocGroup.Add(th *Thunk[T])` — append a closure `func() { th.Force() }`.
    - [ ] `BocGroup.Wait()` — iterate and call each closure. No WaitGroup.
    - [ ] Remove `GoWait`, `GoStore`, `GoStoreAny`.
  - [ ] `types.go` (per scalar: `String`, `Int`, `Bool`, `Decimal`, `Unit`):
    - [ ] Add forwarding methods on `*Thunk[T]` for every method on `T`,
      returning `*Thunk[ReturnType]` via `NewThunk`.
    - [ ] Example: `Thunk[String].Eqeq`, `Thunk[Int].Plus`, `Thunk[Bool].Qm`.

  **Phase 2 — IR (`internal/ir/`)**

  - [ ] `ir.go`: update or remove `SpawnExpr` (currently encodes GoWait/GoStore).
    New form: just `_bg.Add(thunk)`.
  - [ ] `lower.go`:
    - [ ] Remove `thunkVars` map and all `ForceExpr` injection at use sites.
    - [ ] Named boc-call decl (`a : greet()`): emit `a := Greet.Call(); _bg.Add(a)`.
    - [ ] Typed boc-call decl (`a String = greet()`): same — `a` holds `*Thunk[String]`.
    - [ ] Statement boc call (`greet()`): emit `_bg.Add(Greet.Call())`.
    - [ ] Remove `lowerExprForced`; `lowerExpr` always returns the thunk as-is.
    - [ ] Entry-point `main()` shim stays as `Main.Call().Force()` (only explicit
      force in the whole compiler).

  **Phase 3 — Codegen (`internal/codegen/`)**

  - [ ] Update `SpawnExpr` emission to `_bg.Add(thunk)`.
  - [ ] Remove `ForceExpr` codegen except the entry-point path.
  - [ ] `GoStore`/`GoWait`/`GoStoreAny` string literals disappear.

  **Phase 4 — Golden files**

  - [ ] Regenerate all 92+ golden `.go` files.
  - [ ] Add new golden tests for: `greet() == "hi" ? { print("ok") }, {}`,
    inline arithmetic on boc results, string interpolation of thunks.

  **Out of scope for this ticket**

  - Full propagation through ALL method calls (e.g. `Thunk[String].Length`
    on user-defined types) — covered when scalar types move to Yz source
    (YZC-0031), which can generate the forwardings from the method definitions.
  - Changes to sema type inference for thunk-returning expressions.

## Infrastructure

- [x] **[YZC-0093] Uppercase root file (`Foo.yz`) always-wrap: example + spec §9 clarification**

  YZC-0092 implemented always-wrap for lowercase root files only. Uppercase root
  files (e.g. `Foo.yz`) follow the same invariant but have no conformance test.

  Two sub-cases:
  - `Foo.yz` with free-floating fields (`name String; age Int`) → wraps to
    `Foo: { name String; age Int }` — the wrapper IS the struct type.
  - `Foo.yz` with an inner `Foo: {}` → wraps to `Foo: { Foo: {} }` — inner
    becomes an associated type (struct-outer, YZC-0082); `fileWrapperHasInnerBoc`
    should trigger unwrap so the inner `Foo` becomes top-level.

  Work:
  - Add a small root-level uppercase example (e.g. `examples/root_type/`) with
    a `Foo.yz` struct file and a `main.yz` that constructs it
  - Add spec §9 Invariant 1 clarifying note covering both sub-cases
  - Add or promote conformance test

- [x] **[YZC-0092] Always-wrap root files; `main()` as explicit entry invocation**

  Remove the `hasTopLevelBocNamed` guard in `build.go` so all root files are
  always wrapped in a boc named after the file — consistent with spec §9
  Invariant 1 ("file content = boc body named after the file").

  Consequences:
  - `main.yz` with `main: {}` wraps to `main: { main: {} }`. The outer `main`
    executes its body; to run the inner boc the file must call `main()` explicitly.
  - `main.yz` with free-floating statements (no inner `main: {}`) works as-is —
    the outer `main` body just executes them directly.
  - `Foo.yz` with `Foo: {}` wraps to `Foo: { Foo: {} }` — `Foo` inner becomes
    an associated type (YZC-0082). `Foo.yz` with `name String; age Int` wraps
    to `Foo: { name String; age Int }` — struct type, constructor works.

  Work:
  - Remove `hasTopLevelBocNamed` guard and helper from `build.go`
  - Update all existing examples: drop explicit same-name wrapper, or add
    `main()` call at end of `main.yz`
  - Update conformance tests accordingly
  - Add clarifying example to spec §9 Invariant 1 covering `Foo.yz` and
    `main.yz` with inner `main: {}`

- [ ] **[YZC-0091] Nested singleton codegen: sub-singleton struct with own methods**

  `foo: { bar: { baz #() {} } }` — `bar` inside a singleton must lower to a
  sub-singleton struct with its own `Baz()` method, not a closure-returning
  `bar() Unit` method. Currently `foo.bar.baz()` fails:
  `Utils.extra.Help undefined (type func() rt.Unit has no field or method Help)`.

  Test: `examples/_wip/subdir_coexist` — promote when fixed.
  Depends on: YZC-0021. Will be superseded by YZC-0080 (uniform boc literal typing).

- [ ] **[YZC-0090] Multi-return for nested bocs (methods on singleton)**

  Multi-return (`wins, total : summary(3, 5)`) works for top-level singleton bocs
  but not for bocs that are methods on another singleton. `lowerMethod` only
  takes `Returns[0]`; `lowerBocBody` doesn't handle multi-return at all.

  Fix: detect `len(Returns) > 1` in `lowerMethod`, generate a result struct
  (same pattern as `lowerBodyOnlySingleton`), thread return count into
  `lowerBocBody` to collect and wrap the last N trailing expressions.

  Tests added here act as a regression guard when YZC-0080 supersedes this.

- [ ] **[YZC-0022] Multiple source roots**

  `src/` + `lib/` as independent FQN mount points. Depends on: YZC-0085.

- [ ] **[YZC-0023] Cancellation / non-local return**

  non-local `return` across goroutine boundaries; see `docs/Questions/How to cancel a running block.md`.

- [ ] **[YZC-0044] Producer-consumer example and golden test**

  `boring`/`while` producer-consumer in `docs/Features/Concurrency.md`. Depends on: YZC-0031.

- [ ] **[YZC-0058] Native type annotation — `macros: [Native]`**

  compiler-internal annotation for types backed by Go primitives. Depends on: YZC-0025, YZC-0059.

- [ ] **[YZC-0059] Design: macro interface interaction**

- [ ] **[YZC-0060] Design and implement `self` in Yz**

## Major Features

### YZC-0024 — `return`, `break`, `continue`

Blocked on concurrency model (YZC-0019, YZC-0023).

- [ ] Parser — `BreakStmt` / `ContinueStmt` AST nodes
- [ ] Sema — validate context
- [ ] Lowerer — emit compile error when encountered
- [ ] Spec 07 — update
- [ ] Golden tests — sema-level error tests

### YZC-0088 — Codegen: attach compiled annotation boc to declaration metadata

Deferred from YZC-0025. Once the macro system (YZC-0028) is defined, the compiler needs to store the parsed+type-checked annotation `*BocLiteral` alongside its target declaration so that macro passes can inspect and transform it.

- [ ] Define representation: how the annotation boc is stored on `ir.StructDecl` / `ir.SingletonDecl` / `ir.FuncDecl`
- [ ] Codegen — emit annotation metadata in generated Go (or as a side channel for the macro runner)
- [ ] Wire into macro invocation pipeline (YZC-0028)

### YZC-0028 — Macros (`Macro` interface)

Any boc with `Schema #()` and `run #(Boc, Boc)` satisfies `Macro`. Depends on: YZC-0025, YZC-0026, YZC-0027, YZC-0030, YZC-0066, YZC-0059.

- [ ] Sema — recognize `Macro` structural interface
- [ ] Sema — scan annotation for `macros: [...]`
- [ ] Boc metatype — `Boc` value type for `run`
- [ ] Two-phase build — compile `Compile` implementations first
- [ ] Serialization — `Boc` wire format
- [ ] AST merge — merge returned `Boc` into parent
- [ ] Cycle detection
- [ ] Caching — keyed on source hash
- [ ] Spec 12 — new spec file

### YZC-0031 — Scalar Types in Yz Source (uppering)

`Int/String/Bool/Decimal/Unit` move from Go to `stdlib/` with `compile-time:[Native]`. Depends on: YZC-0025, YZC-0028, YZC-0002, YZC-0022 (stdlib needs its own source root, e.g. `/usr/local/yz/src/`).

- [ ] Define `macros: [Native]` annotation semantics
- [ ] Move scalar types to `stdlib/`
- [ ] Annotate native ops per method
- [ ] Implement higher-level methods in Yz
- [ ] Remove all primitive-type special-casing from the compiler
- [ ] `Bool.&&`/`||` — rewrite as lazy closure-taking boc methods

### YZC-0076 — Existential associated types: opaque-token / path-identity tracking

**Status note:** YZC-0075 was superseded by YZC-0079, which established that Yz uses structural typing rather than nominal path-identity for associated types. It is unclear whether this ticket is still needed — the opaque-token / cross-root rejection problem it describes may be moot in a fully structural system. Revisit after YZC-0079 has been used in real code; close if no concrete use case emerges.

Phase 2: the hard part. Deferred until YZC-0079 is settled and there is real usage demand.

- [ ] *design* — decide path-variable representation in the type system
- [ ] *design* — define scoping rules for opaque tokens (block-scoped vs field-storable)
- [ ] Sema — tag values with their existential path root at the point of production
- [ ] Sema — verify path roots match at call sites consuming opaque tokens
- [ ] Sema — reject cross-root usage with a clear error
- [ ] Conformance tests — opaque-token round-trip; cross-root rejection

### YZC-0080 — Uniform boc literal typing: one structural type derived from elements

#### Invariant

> Every boc literal, regardless of where it appears, receives one structural type derived mechanically from its elements. No code path branches on "is this a closure or a struct?" — that distinction is resolved at the use site by structural compatibility, not by classification during analysis.

#### Target design

Every boc literal gets one rich structural type:

```
BocLiteralType {
    Params    []BocParam      // TypedDecl nil-value entries → input signature
    Methods   []MethodField   // ShortDecl+BocLiteral or BocDecl-with-body entries
    Fields    []ValueField    // TypedDecl with value or ShortDecl with non-boc value
    Returns   []Type          // last-expression type(s)
}
```

#### Dependencies

Likely needs YZC-0025 (annotations / compile-time metadata). May also simplify YZC-0031.

- [ ] Design: define `BocLiteralType` in `sema/types.go`
- [ ] Sema: assign `BocLiteralType` to every `*ast.BocLiteral` in `analyzeExpr`; delete classification branches
- [ ] Sema: structural compatibility between `BocLiteralType` and `BocType` / `StructType` / interfaces
- [ ] Lowerer: dispatch on use-site expected type instead of sema classification flags
- [ ] Delete `hasInnerBocsOrMethods`, `bocLitHasParams`, `anonBocCache`, `anonDecls` from lowerer
- [ ] All existing tests pass

### YZC-0082 — Struct-outer nested type (concrete associated type)

`Foo: { Bar: {} }` — `Bar` is a type definition scoped to `Foo`; instances of `Foo` expose it as `f.Bar()`.

- [ ] *design* — decide whether inner type bodies can reference outer instance fields (path-dependent vs. self-contained)
- [ ] Sema: recognize uppercase struct-literal inside struct boc as concrete associated type definition
- [ ] Sema: `f.Bar()` resolves to the inner type; enforce no `Foo.Bar()` static access
- [ ] Lowerer: emit inner type as package-level Go struct; `f.Bar()` → constructor call
- [ ] Golden test: `Foo: { Bar: {} }` + `f.Bar()` compiles and runs

### YZC-0084 — Generic instantiation alias: `StringList : List(String)`

`StringList : List(String)` should declare a type alias for a concrete generic instantiation. Depends on: YZC-0027.

- [ ] *design* — decide emission: `type StringList = List[std.String]` (Go alias) or `type StringList struct { ... }` (copy)
- [ ] Sema: recognize `Name : GenericType(Args)` as instantiation alias
- [ ] Lowerer: emit appropriate Go type declaration
- [ ] `StringList(...)` constructor call works
- [ ] Golden test
