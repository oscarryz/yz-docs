## Implemented Features

### Language
- Singleton bocs, struct bocs, main boc — all uniform (boc uniformity passes 1–4)
- Boc declarations as methods; boc expanded form with named/anonymous param matching
- Type-only boc declarations: data params → struct; all-boc params → Go interface
- Mixed type-only decl: `Name #(name String, greet #())` → struct + method wrappers
- Variant/discriminant sum types: `Pet: { Cat(...), Dog(...) }` with per-variant constructors
- Discriminant match: `match expr { Cat => body }` → Go switch
- Condition match in statement position (if/else) and expression position (IIFE)
- `while` — user-land recursion via boc declaration; `tryLowerWhile` and `yzrt.While` removed
- HOF / closures as arguments: `.filter`, `.each`, `.map` on Array
- Default values in params: `#(name String = "hello")`
- `ShortDecl` as param: `name : "default"` — type inferred from default
- Declare-only then assign-later: `greet #(name String)` then `greet = { ... }`
- Optional parens for trailing-block calls: `list.filter { block }`
- Unary minus: `-x` → `x.Neg()`
- Multiline strings
- String interpolation: `${}` (backtick reserved for infostrings)
- Error reporting: Rust-style diagnostics with source context and caret underlines

### Types & Generics
- All types as `std.*` structs; literal boxing in codegen
- Generic structs: `Box: { T; value T }` → `Box[T any]`; generic variant types: `Option: { V; Some(value V); None() }`
- Generic type vars in boc declarations: `identity #(value V, V)` → `func identity[V any]`
- Generic constraint inference: sema infers from usage; reports all violations at once
- Go constraint generation: emits `[T interface{ Method() }]` from inferred constraints
- Multiple type params: `#(key K, value V)` → `[K any, V any]`
- Typed generic declaration: `b Box(String) = Box("hello")`; uninstantiated generics in type positions

### Concurrency (BOC — all phases complete)
- A: mutex cowns — data-race freedom
- B.1: queue-based cown scheduler — lock-free, spawn-order guarantee
- B.2: `ScheduleMulti` — atomic multi-cown acquisition
- C: ownership-based field writes (SWMR); cross-cown writes via `Schedule`
- D: struct boc instances embed `std.Cown`; fresh instance per call site for multi-cown boc declarations
- E.1: implicit BocGroup per scope; split-BocGroup pattern; `ScheduleAsSuccessor`
- E.3: plain scalar types (no lazy fields); `GoStore[T]`/`GoWait`; `*Thunk[T]` internal to runtime

### Runtime / Built-ins
- `http` singleton: `http.get(uri)`, `http.post(uri, body)`
- `print`, `Info`, `BocGroup` structured concurrency
- `Array[T]`, `Dict[K,V]`, `Range` with HOF: `.filter`, `.each`, `.map`
- `yzc run` — compile + execute in one step
- Cross-package singleton method calls
- `examples/milestone/` — concurrent HTTP fetch + counter boc (first milestone)

## Open Work

Ticket numbers: `YZC-NNNN`. Numbers are permanent — closed tickets keep their number.

### Bugs

- [x] **[YZC-0001] Variants broken**

  variants were not updated for the BOC model; see `examples/variants`

- [ ] **[YZC-0002] Cross-package broken**

  broke during BOC migration

- [x] **[YZC-0003] Assigning Unit-returning boc to variable**

  `a : foo()` where `foo` returns Unit should be a sema error (analogue to Go's `x := f()` where `f` returns nothing); detect in sema; add error golden test

- [x] **[YZC-0004] Top-level boc callable as function**

  implemented: `lowerCall` and `isBocMethodCall` extended for plain body singletons (BocType, Node != nil, ParentTypeName == "") → `Foo.Call(args)`, and structured singletons (StructType{IsSingleton:true}) → `Foo.Call(args)`; `lowerBodyOnlySingleton` now reads return type from sema and converts last ExprStmt to ReturnStmt for non-Unit returns. Golden test 55.

- [~] **[YZC-0005] Double return with sleep**

  `foo: { time.sleep(1); 1 }` emits two return statements in generated Go — *not reproducible as of BOC work; superseded by YZC-0035*

- [x] **[YZC-0006] Standalone boc invocation**

  resolved by YZC-0004: `p()` now lowers to `P.Call()` via the plain body singleton path. Golden test 56.

- [x] **[YZC-0007] Unused variables in generated Go**

  implemented: `emitBodyStmts` pre-scans the full statement list via `usedNames`/`collectUsedStmt`/`collectUsedExpr`; emits `_ = varName` immediately after any `DeclStmt` whose name is never read (plain-Ident assignment targets excluded); `SpawnExpr.GroupVar`, `SpawnExpr.StoreVar`, `WaitStmt.GroupVar` counted as reads. Golden test 54.

- [x] **[YZC-0048] Flaky test 51 — concurrent output ordering**

  `51_lazy_scalar_variable` was failing intermittently because the code is correct: `Counter.Increment(n)` and `P.Call()` run on different cowns with no ordering guarantee between them — the program behaves as designed. The `.output` sidecar had a wrong expectation (assumed a specific print ordering that the semantics do not guarantee). Fixed by deleting `51_lazy_scalar_variable.output` — the runtime test is skipped; the golden source-diff test still verifies the generated code structure. If a runtime test is re-added, the harness should support unordered line matching for concurrent output.

- [ ] **[YZC-0008] Reentrant inline calls unsafe in HOF closures**

  closure emitted inside a `ScheduleMulti` body and passed as argument to another boc contains sync-body calls that bypass cown acquisition; fix: sub-generator with `heldCowns = nil` when emitting closure args; dormant until HOF closures operate on cown-bearing types

- [x] **[YZC-0035] Sema does not check boc body return type against declared output**

  when a boc declares a non-Unit output type (e.g. `foo #(Int)`) but the body's last expression returns Unit (e.g. only `time.sleep` or `print` calls), sema accepts it silently; the lowerer then emits `return std.TheUnit` which fails at `go build` with a type error; affects any void-returning call in that position, not just sleep; fix: after inferring the body's return type, verify it matches the declared output type and report a sema error

### Language Features

- [x] **[YZC-0034] Definite assignment analysis (phase 1 replaced by YZC-0051)**

  `StructField.HasDefault` added to distinguish required vs optional fields. Original `checkStructConstructorArgs` was too conservative (blocked valid "fill in later" pattern) and has been removed; replaced by YZC-0051.

- [ ] **[YZC-0049] Lowerer: singleton boc params not emitted**

  when a singleton boc body contains `TypedDecl`-no-value entries (required params), `lowerBodyOnlySingleton` ignores them and generates `Call()` with no parameters; the caller then emits `Foo.Call(a)` referencing an undefined variable, producing a Go compile error. Fix: collect leading TypedDecl-no-value elements in `lowerBodyOnlySingleton` and emit them as `Call(a std.T, ...)` params; also inject them as Go variables at the start of the body closure so references resolve. Reproducer: `foo: { n Int; print(n) }; main: { foo(5) }`.

- [x] **[YZC-0051] CFG-based field definite-assignment**

  `FieldInitState` in `sema/definite_assign.go` tracks which fields of locally-constructed structs (`b : Bar(...)`) are definitely assigned on all control-flow paths; reports "YZC-0034: field f used before initialization" at the READ site; correctly handles ConditionalExpr branch merge (intersect), match arm merge (intersect), while/closure isolation (conservative — don't propagate); TypedDecl-no-value parameters always considered initialized (untracked); struct fields accessed in methods always initialized (untracked); error tests 13 (updated) and 14 (new). Note: codegen for "fill in later" (`b : Bar(); b.f = …`) generates `NewBar()` with wrong arity — tracked as a codegen follow-up under YZC-0049. Commit: c7065da.

- [ ] **[YZC-0052] Codegen "fill in later" — wrong arity on `NewBar()`**

  discovered during YZC-0051 (commit c7065da). When a struct is constructed with fewer args than required fields (`b : Bar()`) and fields are assigned later (`b.f = "hello"`), sema correctly accepts the code but the lowerer still emits `NewBar()` with no arguments; Go rejects it because `NewBar` expects one arg per required field. Fix: either (a) extend YZC-0049's singleton-params work to struct constructors (emit a zero-arg constructor + setter calls), or (b) change the Go representation so struct fields are individual assignable vars rather than constructor params. Depends on: YZC-0049.

- [ ] **[YZC-0053] CFG check at boc-boundary crossing**

  discovered during YZC-0051 (commit c7065da). Passing a locally-constructed struct with uninitialized required fields as an argument to another boc is not caught by the current definite-assignment analysis. Example: `b : Bar(); foo(b)` where `foo` expects a fully-initialized `Bar` and reads `b.f`. Fix: at `analyzeCall`, for each argument whose type is a `*StructType`, verify that all required fields of the corresponding local variable are definitely assigned in `a.fieldInit` before the call crosses the boc boundary.

- [ ] **[YZC-0054] CFG: multi-level field access not tracked**

  discovered during YZC-0051 (commit c7065da). `FieldInitState` only handles one level of access (`b.f`). Accessing `b.inner.field` where `inner` is itself a struct-typed required field of `b` is not tracked; the analysis neither marks `inner` as assigned when `b.inner = ...` is written, nor checks initialization when `b.inner.field` is read. Fix: extend `markAssigned` / `isAssigned` to handle chained member paths, and recurse into the struct type of `inner` when evaluating definite assignment.

- [ ] **[YZC-0055] CFG: variable aliasing defeats tracking**

  discovered during YZC-0051 (commit c7065da). When a tracked local variable is copied to another variable (`c : b`), `c` is not added to `FieldInitState` as a tracked var (it is a ShortDecl, but the RHS is an identifier, not a constructor call). Reads through `c.f` will always pass the check even if `b.f` is unset. Fix: at `analyzeShortDecl`, when the RHS is an `*ast.Ident` whose symbol is a tracked local struct var, clone that var's field-init state under the new name.

- [ ] **[YZC-0056] CFG: variant type construction skipped**

  discovered during YZC-0051 (commit c7065da). `initLocalVar` in `definite_assign.go` skips `IsVariant` structs, so variant-typed locals are never added to `FieldInitState`. If a variant constructor sets only some fields (non-exhaustive per-variant field sets), reads of unset fields will pass the check unchallenged. Fix: determine the correct exhaustiveness rule for variants (each variant provides exactly its declared fields; the variant constructor call covers them) and apply `initLocalVar` to variant-typed ShortDecl locals with the per-variant field list.

- [ ] **[YZC-0009] Range iteration**

  `1.to(10).each({ i Int; ... })` — lowerer recognizes `.each` on Array only; extend to Range receiver. Depends on: YZC-0031.

- [ ] **[YZC-0010] HOF iteration + cown happens-before**

  resolved by YZC-0036: HOF methods use `a→b→a` indirect recursion → ScheduleAsSuccessor at each step → sequential processing behaviour. No further design needed; implement as sequential closure calls.

- [x] **[YZC-0036] While loop yield and external caller interleaving**

  implemented: BocDecl singletons now use `std.Schedule(&self.Cown, ...)` instead of `std.Go`; recursive self-calls emit `self.Call(args)` with `IsRecursive=true` so codegen bypasses `ScheduleAsSuccessor` and uses the regular goroutine path (tail-queue semantics). Non-recursive inner calls retain `ScheduleAsSuccessor`. See `docs/Questions/solved/While loop yield and external caller interleaving.md`.

- [x] **[YZC-0011] Named arguments in constructor calls**

  `Person(name: "Alice", age: 30)`: `lowerStructArgs` reorders by `st.Fields` data-field order; `lowerNamedArgs` replaces `fillDefaults` for BocDecl calls — handles reordering, order independence, and any-position defaults (not just trailing). Both struct constructors and BocDecl calls supported in the same pass. Syntax `:` preserved. Golden test 59.

- [ ] **[YZC-0012] Multiple return values**

  `x, y = swap(x, y)` — multi-assign LHS not in any golden test

- [ ] **[YZC-0013] Array append via `<<`**

  `a << item` → `a.Append(item)`; `Array.Append` exists in yzrt. Depends on: YZC-0031.

- [ ] **[YZC-0014] Option/Result method chaining**

  `result.or_else({ error Error; ... })`, `result.and_then({ val T; ... })`
  

- [x] **[YZC-0015] Non-word boc names**

  `balance+= #(amount Int) { ... }` — parser only allows word identifiers in boc declarations; fix: accept `NON_WORD` token; map to Go-safe name via symbol table; add golden test

- [ ] **[YZC-0016] String concatenation with `++`**

  lowerer emits `Plusplus` but runtime `String` has no such method; implement `++` in Yz source when String moves to stdlib. Depends on: YZC-0031.

- [ ] **[YZC-0017] Dict optional access**

  `d[key]` should return `Option(V)`; currently panics on missing key via `At()`

- [x] **[YZC-0018] Bool methods `&&` / `||`**

  `Bool.Ampamp` / `Bool.Pipepipe` exist in yzrt; golden test 53 confirms end-to-end. *Note: current operators are eager sync calls, special-cased on built-in Bool; when Bool moves to Yz source (YZC-0031), `&&`/`||` become lazy closure-taking boc methods that go through the normal BOC cycle — see YZC-0031 sub-item.*

- [ ] **[YZC-0019] `break` / `continue` / `return` in loops**

  blocked on concurrency model settling; lowerer should emit compile error when encountered rather than silently dropping

- [x] **[YZC-0020] Compiler homoiconic dump — backtick interpolation inside strings**

  backtick inside a string literal (`` "debug: `x`" ``) triggers a compiler-generated homoiconic representation: instances render as `Person(name: "Alice", age: 30)`, arrays/dicts pretty-print, types render as their signature `Person #(name String, age Int)`, cycle detection prevents infinite recursion. The lowerer must: (1) emit a Go `String() string` method on every user-defined struct for `fmt.Stringer` compatibility; (2) recognise `` ` `` as an interpolation delimiter inside strings and call `Stringify()` on the value. No user method required — this is pure compiler magic.

- [x] **[YZC-0037] Decimal type end-to-end**

  `std.Decimal` wired end-to-end: literals (`3.14`), arithmetic (`+`,`-`,`*`,`/`), comparisons, unary minus, `abs()`, `pow()`, `to_str()` all compile and generate correct Go; `to_str` added as alias for `to_string` in builtinMethods and yzMethodToGoName; fixed misleading "Integer division result" section in docs/Features/Decimal.md. Golden test 58.

- [ ] **[YZC-0038] `Result(T,E)` type**

  error handling doc specifies `Result(T,E)` alongside `Option(T)` but `Result` is not implemented in yzrt; implement as a variant type, wire up sema/lowerer recognition; `and_then`/`or_else` method chaining follows from YZC-0014. Spec: `docs/Features/Error handling.md`.

- [ ] **[YZC-0039] Operators audit**

  systematic comparison of operators documented in spec vs. implemented in yzrt and recognised by the lowerer; covers `%`, bitwise ops, string operators, and any gaps; add golden tests for each gap found. See `docs/Questions/Operators.md`.

- [ ] **[YZC-0040] Smart Nesting / Namespace Flattening**

  when a directory name matches the boc file inside it (e.g. `house/house.yz`), the namespace is flattened so callers use `house.method` not `house.house.method`; implement in FQN resolution. Spec: `docs/Features/Smart Nesting and Namespace Flattening.md`. Depends on: YZC-0021.

- [ ] **[YZC-0043] Captured variable reference semantics**

  design question: when a boc literal captures an outer variable, does it capture by value or by reference? Mutable captured state (e.g. a counter updated across iterations) needs a clear semantic and a runtime strategy. See `docs/Questions/Memory Management.md` and `docs/Questions/Variables lifetime.md`.

- [ ] **[YZC-0045] Default values in type-only boc declarations (interfaces)**

  `Greeter #(name String = "Alice")` and `Greeter #(name: "Alice")` (shortdecl form, type inferred) should follow the same syntax rules as defaults in regular boc declarations. Semantics: defaults live at the call site — when a value typed as `Greeter` is called and a defaulted param is omitted, the interface-declared default fills it in. This is interpretation (2): defaults are call-site sugar, not a structural constraint on implementations. Depends on: YZC-0011 (named args + order independence needed to make omission useful).

- [x] **[YZC-0046] `${}` interpolation requires `to_str`**

  `${x}` in a string is a compile error unless `x`'s type defines a `to_str #(String)` method. `to_str` is a plain Yz method with no special compiler status — sema checks for its presence and the lowerer calls it. No `ToStr` interface object is needed. Built-in types already have `to_str`. Depends on: YZC-0020 (lexer/parser must support both interpolation forms before checking them).

- [ ] **[YZC-0047] Cycle detection in homoiconic `Stringify`**

	The current `Stringify` / generated `String()` chain recurses into nested struct fields without tracking visited pointers; a self-referential or mutually-referential struct graph causes a stack overflow. Fix: thread a visited-pointer set through `Stringify`; on re-entry emit `TypeName(...)` (include type params for generics). Only types with struct-typed fields need the guard — primitives cannot form cycles. Runtime `Array` and `Dict` should also be covered.

	**Deferred:** Yz sema rejects forward type references, so cyclic data graphs cannot currently be produced by Yz source. A Yz-level conformance test requires YZC-0057. A Go-level unit test can verify cycle safety independently. Depends on: YZC-0020, YZC-0057.

- [ ] **[YZC-0057] Cyclic / mutually-recursive type declarations**

  sema processes declarations in source order, so `Node: { next Node }` and `Parent: { child Child }; Child: { parent Parent }` both fail with "undefined type". Fix: two-pass sema — collect all top-level type names first, then resolve field types. Codegen already emits pointer fields for struct-typed fields, so no codegen change is needed. Unblocks the Yz-level conformance test for YZC-0047.

- [ ] **[YZC-0044] Producer-consumer example and golden test**

  the `boring`/`while` producer-consumer in `docs/Features/Concurrency.md` cannot be exercised yet: `while` iterations run on `while.Cown`, but `boring.next()` is on `boring.Cown`; the two cowns don't interact. Full interleaving requires either (a) the "every value is a protected resource" model so `messages` has its own cown serialising push/pop (depends on YZC-0031 uppering), or (b) a simpler stand-in resource that has its own cown. Once unblocked: add a concrete runnable example and a runtime golden test that proves `boring.next()` interleaves between `while` iterations as shown in the timing diagram.

### Infrastructure

- [x] **[YZC-0033] Compiler deep review against settled spec**

  all four sub-items resolved: (1) BocDecl lowers to singleton structs with cowns (via YZC-0036); (2) `foo.param` accessible after call — lowerCall now uses `Foo.Call(args)` (singleton) instead of `(&_fooBoc{}).Call(args)` (fresh instance), so `greet.name` reads `Greet.name` after the BocGroup wait, golden test 57; (3) sema errors say "returns nothing" (`displayType` helper, YZC-0003 check); (4) all bocs serialized through cown (via YZC-0036).

  - [x] spec/02 grammar updated: labeled=input/unlabeled=output rule, BocDecl three forms, MixStmt removed
  - [x] sema errors say "returns nothing" instead of "Unit" (`displayType` helper, YZC-0003 check)
  - [x] BocDecl calls use singleton (`Foo.Call`) not fresh instance (`(&_fooBoc{}).Call`) — foo.param accessible after call. Golden test 57.

- [ ] **[YZC-0021] Directory and file bocs**

  defer until in-file nesting works; extend FQN tree to directories and files as bocs

- [x] **[YZC-0032] Rename `BocWithSig` in compiler code**

  AST node `BocWithSig`, sema path `analyzeBocWithSig`, lowerer path `lowerBocWithSig`, and all related identifiers should be renamed to `BocDecl` / `analyzeBocDecl` / `lowerBocDecl` to match the settled terminology; also rename the `BocWithSig` → `BocDecl` grammar production in spec/02

- [ ] **[YZC-0022] Multiple source roots**

  `src/` + `lib/` as independent FQN mount points; compiler accepts list of source roots; builds one FQN forest per root

- [ ] **[YZC-0023] Cancellation / non-local return**

  non-local `return` across goroutine boundaries conflicts with structured concurrency; see `docs/Questions/How to cancel a running block.md`

### Tooling

- [ ] **[YZC-0041] Dependency management**

  design + implement HTTPS-based import resolution; a source file declares a dependency by URL; the compiler fetches and caches the source; safety, version locking, and checksum verification TBD. See `docs/Questions/Dependency Management.md`.

- [ ] **[YZC-0042] Package management (`yz` tool)**
- [ ] 
  `yz init`, `yz add <url>`, `yz remove`, lock file, local cache; depends on YZC-0041. See `docs/Questions/Package management.md`.

## Major Features

### YZC-0024 — `return`, `break`, `continue`

Blocked on concurrency model settling (see YZC-0019 and YZC-0023).

- [ ] Parser — `BreakStmt` / `ContinueStmt` AST nodes (tokens already exist)
- [ ] Sema — validate context: `break`/`continue` only inside loop; `return` tracks nearest named boc
- [ ] Lowerer — emit compile error when encountered (fail loudly)
- [ ] Spec 07 — update control-flow spec
- [ ] Golden tests — sema-level error tests

### YZC-0025 — Infostrings: content is a boc body

Infostring delimiter stays backtick; content is full Yz syntax, parsed and type-checked, never executed.

- [ ] AST — `InfoString` holds `*BocLiteral` instead of `*StringLit`
- [ ] Lexer — re-lex infostring content as Yz source
- [ ] Parser — re-parse as boc body using existing boc-body parser
- [ ] Sema — type-check content; validate referenced names
- [ ] Codegen — attach compiled infostring boc to declaration metadata
- [ ] Spec 01 — update

### YZC-0026 — Generics: Explicit Constraint Declaration

`thing T Talker` declares `T` must implement `Talker`; additive with inference.

- [ ] Parser — `T Constraint` optional suffix after single-uppercase-letter type param
- [ ] Sema — validate at instantiation; union with inferred constraints
- [ ] Error messages — explicit vs inferred violations distinct
- [ ] Spec 04 — update

### YZC-0027 — `:` as Type Alias

`Name : SomeType` declares a type alias usable anywhere.

- [ ] Feature doc — `docs/Features/Type Alias.md`
- [ ] Parser — distinguish `Name : TypeExpr` (alias) from `Name TypeExpr` (typed decl) and `name : value` (short decl)
- [ ] Sema — register alias; resolve as aliased type; no runtime fields
- [ ] Lowerer — emit `type Name = GoType`
- [ ] Spec 04 — add

### YZC-0028 — Compile-Time Bocs (`Compile` interface)

Any boc with `Schema #()` and `run #(Boc, Boc)` satisfies `Compile`. Depends on: YZC-0025, YZC-0026, YZC-0027, YZC-0030.

- [ ] Sema — recognize `Compile` structural interface (duck-typed)
- [ ] Sema — scan infostring for `compile_time: [...]`; schedule during type inference
- [ ] Boc metatype — `Boc` value type for `run`: `{name String, fields [Boc], methods [Boc], ...}`
- [ ] Two-phase build — compile `Compile` implementations first; call via subprocess during main compilation
- [ ] Serialization — `Boc` wire format (JSON or binary) for subprocess calls
- [ ] AST merge — merge returned `Boc` into parent boc's AST
- [ ] Cycle detection — circular `compile_time` triggers → compile error
- [ ] Caching — keyed on source hash + input boc structure hash
- [ ] Spec 12 — new spec file

### YZC-0029 — Remove `mix`: runtime + spec — PARTIALLY COMPLETE

Compiler removal done. Remaining work depends on YZC-0028.

- [x] Lexer — removed `token.MIX`
- [x] Parser — removed `MixStmt`; `mix` is now a regular identifier
- [x] Sema — removed mix analysis (embedding resolution, conflict detection)
- [x] Lowering/Codegen — removed Go-embedding path
- [x] Golden tests — updated / removed mix-using conformance tests
- [ ] Runtime — implement `Mix` as a `Compile` boc in yzrt or stdlib
- [ ] Spec 09 — remove `mix`; document `Mix` compile implementation

### YZC-0030 — Associated Types: Path-Dependent Type References

`process(g Graph, n g.Node)` — no new syntax; sema resolves `g.Node` at the call site by looking up `Node` on the concrete type bound to `g`. See decisions 50–51 in `decisions.md`.

- [ ] Sema — `value.TypeName` in type position; resolve against concrete type of `value`
- [ ] Lowerer — emit concrete Go type at resolution site
- [ ] Golden test — `associated_types.yz`

### YZC-0031 — Scalar Types in Yz Source (uppering)

Prerequisite: E.3 complete (done). `Int/String/Bool/Decimal/Unit` move from Go to `stdlib/` with `compile-time:[Native]` annotation. Native ops annotated per method; higher-level methods (`times`, `to`, `clamp`, `>=`, `Ord`) in plain Yz. Depends on: YZC-0025, YZC-0028.

- [ ] Define `compile-time:[Native]` infostring semantics (depends on YZC-0025)
- [ ] Move scalar types to `stdlib/`
- [ ] Annotate native ops per method
- [ ] Implement higher-level methods in Yz

- [ ] Remove all primitive-type special-casing from the compiler
- [ ] `Bool.&&` / `Bool.||` — rewrite as lazy closure methods `#(other #(Bool), Bool)`; calls go through the normal BOC cycle (return `*Thunk[Bool]`, participate in BocGroup/GoWait) instead of the current eager sync `Ampamp`/`Pipepipe`; lowerer wraps bare expression operands in a closure: `a && b` → `a.Ampamp({ b })`

## Ticket Rules

- `YZC-NNNN` numbers are permanent and never reused; closed items keep their number
- Numbers are assigned in creation order; next available: **YZC-0058**
- `depends-on` is a flat reference to ticket numbers — no nested phase hierarchy
- Reference tickets in commit messages and code comments for easy grep: `// YZC-0008`
- When the open list in any section exceeds ~10 items, split into a `tickets/` directory with one file per ticket
